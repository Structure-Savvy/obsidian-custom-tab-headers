# Custom Tab Headers

Welcome to the documentation for the [Custom Tab Headers](https://github.com/Structure-Savvy/obsidian-custom-tab-headers){: .external-link target=_blank } plugin for Obsidian.

This plugin lets you customize how tabs appear in the editor, adding meaningful titles, styling them with classes, and optionally adding emojis or icons. It's designed to make navigating your workspace faster, clearer, and more personal.

No more searching for the right tab. With custom titles and dynamic styling, your open files become easier to scan at a glance.

## What You Can Do

- Set custom tab titles using frontmatter or folder structure
- Add secondary titles and tooltips for context
- Style tabs with emojis, CSS classes, or SVG icons
- Use automation (Templater, Dataview, Meta Bind) to scale your setup
- Create dynamic dashaboards with task-aware tab headers

- Manages multiple projects in Obsidian
